The project consists in creating a game 3D engines based on WebGL, which we chose to be Babylon.js. Our game has been a reinterpretation of the classic arcade shooter based on zombie/ghost invasion, with a spherical map inspired on the well known video game Nintendo Mario Galaxy.
The player plays the role of a sole survivor and has to defend himself and his house form a horde of ghosts coming form a red crystal placed outside the barrier of his property. He is provided with three lives at the beginning of the game, he can shoot enemies with a gun and he can walk in every part of the planet.
